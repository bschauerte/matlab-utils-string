# Matlab String Utilities

This is a small collections of convenience string processing functions that I frequently use in my Matlab code.

* **CSTRTOK** tokenizes string S with respect to delimiter D.
* **CSTRTOKINV** provides the inverse functionality to cstrtok, i.e. it constructs a string out of tokens with a delimiter (sep) in between the tokens.
* **STRDATE** returns the date as a numerical, '-'-separated date string.
* **STRDATE** returns the date as a numerical, '-'-separated date string. In contrast to strdate, it includes seconds.
* **STRSTRIPSPACES** removes all "unnecessary" spaces (i.e., double or trailing spaces).
